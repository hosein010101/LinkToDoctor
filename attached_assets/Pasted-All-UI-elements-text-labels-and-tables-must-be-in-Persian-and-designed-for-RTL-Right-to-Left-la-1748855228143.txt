All UI elements, text, labels, and tables must be in Persian and designed for RTL (Right-to-Left) layout.

Use a clean layout with light backgrounds, rounded tables, and modular sections.

Ensure that filters, tables, modals, and detail panels are fully responsive and accessible.

📋 Functional Requirements:
Main Table View (لیست سفارش‌ها):

Display all registered lab orders in a structured table.

Show columns such as: Order ID, Patient Name (نام بیمار), Registration Date (تاریخ ثبت), Doctor (پزشک), Services (خدمات), Payment Status (وضعیت پرداخت), Sample Collector (نمونه‌گیر), and Location (لوکیشن).

Advanced Filters (فیلتر پیشرفته):

Filters by:

Date range (تاریخ)

Patient name or ID (بیمار)

Referring doctor (پزشک)

Sampling status (وضعیت نمونه‌گیری): Pending / Collected / In Transit / Completed

Assigned sample collector (نمونه‌گیر)

Location filter: Address and interactive map view (آدرس و نقشه)

Order Details Modal (جزئیات سفارش):

Clicking any row opens a modal or separate page with full details:

Service items

Patient contact info

Notes or history logs

Uploaded documents or photos

Editable fields like status or notes

Interactive Map Integration (نقشه تعاملی):

Show the patient’s sample collection location on a map.

Option to view nearby collectors or plan optimized sampling routes.

UI Components:

Persian UI labels with clean icons

Collapsible filter panel

Expandable rows or modals for viewing details

Sorting by column headers

Pagination or infinite scroll

Design Behavior:

Entire dashboard and this page should support zoom-in / zoom-out interactions.

Hover effects and row highlighting for better user experience.

Must match the overall style of the dashboard with soft colors and modern typography.

✅ Additional Notes:
Emphasize simplicity, usability, and data clarity.

Design for administrative roles: lab managers and operators.

Do not use placeholder text like lorem ipsum. Use real Persian sample values (e.g., patient names, doctor names, order codes).

Final layout must be fully RTL and visually consistent with the rest of the dashboard.
