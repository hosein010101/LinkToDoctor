I am developing the functionality for a user profile dropdown menu within my dashboard application. The application is built using React, Tailwind CSS, and likely React Router for navigation. I have defined the following menu items and the actions that should occur upon clicking each. I need guidance on the best practices for implementing these actions, including component structure, routing, state management, API interactions, and user experience considerations.

**Profile Menu Items and Their Intended Actions:**

1.  **User Profile (پروفایل کاربری):**
    * **Action:** Navigate the user to a dedicated 'User Profile' page.
    * **Page Features:** This page should display the user's information (e.g., name, role like 'مدیر آزمایشگاه', email, avatar) and allow editing of editable fields. It might also include user activity logs or specific preferences.

2.  **Account Settings (تنظیمات حساب):**
    * **Action:** Navigate the user to an 'Account Settings' page.
    * **Page Features:** This page should allow management of account-related preferences such as notification settings, general application settings (if not covered elsewhere), and potentially connected accounts or integrations.

3.  **Security & Privacy (امنیت و حریم خصوصی):**
    * **Action:** Navigate the user to a 'Security & Privacy' settings page.
    * **Page Features:** This page should include functionality for changing the password, managing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), viewing active sessions (with an option to log out other sessions), and accessing the application's privacy policy.

4.  **Change Language (تغییر زبان):**
    * **Action & UI:** Upon clicking, either:
        * Open an in-context modal or a small sub-menu directly within/near the main dropdown. This should allow immediate selection from available languages (e.g., Persian, English).
        * Alternatively, navigate to a dedicated section within 'Account Settings' or 'User Profile' for language selection.
    * **Functionality:** The UI language should update instantly upon selection (preferably without a full page reload). The selected language preference must be saved (e.g., using localStorage, context API, or backend persistence).

5.  **Help & Support (راهنما و پشتیبانی):**
    * **Action & UI:** Upon clicking, either:
        * Navigate the user to a dedicated 'Help Center' or 'Support' page within the application. This page should feature FAQs, a searchable knowledge base/documentation, and support contact information (or a ticket submission form).
        * Alternatively, open a modal for quick help, FAQs search, or to initiate a support request.

6.  **Logout from System (خروج از سامانه):**
    * **Action & UI:**
        * Display a confirmation modal (e.g., "Are you sure you want to log out?").
        * If confirmed by the user, invalidate the current session, log the user out of the application.
        * Redirect the user to the login page.

**Request for Guidance:**

Please provide advice and suggestions on the following aspects for implementing these features:

* **Component Structure:** Recommendations for structuring the React components for the new pages (User Profile, Account Settings, Security & Privacy, Help Center) and any modals (e.g., Language Selection Modal, Logout Confirmation Modal).
* **Routing:** Best practices for defining and managing routes for these navigable sections using React Router.
* **State Management:** Tips for managing relevant application state (e.g., current user data, selected language, session status, form input for settings).
* **API Interaction Strategy:** Considerations for interacting with backend APIs (e.g., for fetching/updating user profile data, persisting settings, session invalidation on logout). What kind of API endpoints would typically support these actions?
* **User Experience (UX) Best Practices:**
    * How to provide clear visual feedback during operations (e.g., loading indicators for API calls, success/error notifications for actions like profile updates or password changes).
    * Recommendations for implementing the language switching mechanism smoothly.
    * Best way to handle the logout confirmation and session termination.
* **Modularity and Integration:** How to ensure these features are developed as modular components that integrate cleanly with the existing dashboard structure without causing side effects on unrelated parts of the application.

I am looking for actionable advice, potential high-level code structure examples, and any relevant design patterns or best practices suitable for a React/Tailwind CSS environment.
