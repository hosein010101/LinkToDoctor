Create a modern and responsive admin dashboard page in React + Tailwind titled "Sample Collection Management". Include the following sections:

1. Header with summary stats: 
   - "Pending Collections", "In Progress", "Active Collectors", "Available Collectors"

2. Active Sample Collections:
   - Display profile cards with collector name (e.g., Fatemeh Ahmadi), avatar, status ("In Progress"), and online indicator
   - Include action buttons: "View Mission", "Call", "Report Issue", "End Task"

3. Available Collectors:
   - List of available collectors (name, phone, online status)
   - Actions: "Assign Task", "View Profile"
   - Use small profile avatars and toggle indicators

4. Task Assignment Module:
   - Dropdown to select collector
   - Input for test request ID or patient name
   - Time and location selection (with optional map preview)
   - Notes section and Submit button

5. Live Map Section:
   - Show real-time location of active collectors and test locations

6. Supervisor Tools:
   - List collectors by supervisor responsibility
   - Allow supervisor to track, comment, and rate collectors

7. Alert System:
   - If task is pending >30 mins or collector is idle, show toast alerts or warning badges

8. Daily Performance Section:
   - Table showing collectorsâ€™ daily sample count, success rate, and average time
   - Allow filtering by date, location, or supervisor

9. UI Design:
   - Remove all yellow backgrounds and borders across this page
   - Use white background for cards and light gray (#f3f4f6) for containers
   - Black or dark-gray for borders and texts, modern font
   - Action buttons with icons and hover effects

10. Footer:
   - Sticky footer that does not overlap any content or buttons
   - Contains date/time, quick links, and online status

Make all dropdowns have a clear border, white background, and readable text. Also update the scrollbar color to a modern gray. Ensure this design supports Persian (RTL) text as well.
